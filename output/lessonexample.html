<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This project is like the game <strong>Whack-a-Mole</strong>. You get points for hitting the ghosts that appear on the screen. The aim is to get as many points as possible in 30 seconds!</p>

<h1>STEP 1: Create a flying ghost</h1>
<section id="activity-checklist" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<p>+. <strong>Start a new scratch project.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove the cat sprite</strong> and replace the background with the <strong>nature/woods</strong><br />background.<br /></li>
<li>Use the <code>new sprite from file</code> button to add a new ghoul<br />sprite to the project (use the <strong>fantasy/ghost1</strong> costume).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now we want to make our ghost move</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add a <code>Variable</code> for this sprite only called <code>speed</code>.<br />On the <strong>Stage</strong>, the stage monitor for this variable should say “<strong>Sprite1 speed</strong>”.<br />If it just says “speed”, delete the variable and create it again, for this sprite only. Uncheck the box next to the speed block in the<br /><strong>Variables palette</strong> so it does not show on the Stage.<br />The speed variable will control how fast the ghost moves. We use a variable so that we can change how fast the ghost moves as the game progresses.<br /></li>
<li>We want the ghost to start moving when the game starts, <strong>so make a script like this</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="blocks"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    set [speed] to (5)
    forever
        move [speed] steps</code></pre>
</section>
<section id="test-your-project" class="level2 flag">
<h2>Test Your Project</h2>
<p><strong>Click the green flag</strong> and see what your ghost does. Why does it get stuck on the edge of the screen?</p>
</section>
<section id="activity-checklist-1" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>To stop the ghost getting stuck we need to make her go back the other way when it touches the edge of the screen. Edit your existing script by adding a an <code>if on edge, bounce</code> block below your<br /><code>move speed steps</code> block.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="blocks"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    set [speed] to (5)
    forever
        move [speed] steps
        if on edge, bounce</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>To stop the ghost flipping upside down, click on the <code>only face left-right</code> button in the Sprite Summary area.</li>
</ul>

<section id="things-to-try" class="level2 try">
<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try changing the value of the speed variable to make the ghost fly faster or slower.</strong><br /></li>
<li><strong>How would you make the ghost get faster the longer it flies?</strong><br />(This is a tricky one, so don’t worry if you can’t see how to do it. You’ll get more clues as you work through the project.)</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-2-make-the-ghost-appear-vanish-randomly" class="level1 activity">
<h1>STEP 2: Make the ghost appear &amp; vanish randomly</h1>
<p>To make the game more fun, we want the ghost to appear and vanish randomly. We’ll do that with another script that runs at the same time as the one that moves the ghost. This new script needs to hide the ghost for a random time, then show it for a random time, and repeat that forever (or until the game finishes).</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-2" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<p><strong>Create this script for the ghost:</strong></p>
<pre class="blocks"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    forever
        hide
        wait (pick random (2) to (5) secs)
        show
        wait (pick random (3) to (5) secs)
</code></pre>

<h2>Things to try</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try changing the range of the random numbers. What happens if you pick very big numbers or very small numbers?</strong><br />(Does this give you any more clues for how to make the ghost speed up the longer the game is played?)</li>
</ul>

<section id="step-3-make-the-ghost-disappear-when-its-clicked" class="level1 activity">
<h1>STEP 3: Make the ghost disappear when it's clicked</h1>
<p>To turn this into a game, we need to give the player something to do. They need to click on the ghost to make it disappear. When the ghost is clicked, we want it to disappear and play a sound.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-3" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <strong>Sounds</strong> tab, import the sound <strong>electronic/fairydust</strong>.</p></li>

<section id="step-4-add-a-score-and-timer" class="level1 activity">
<h1>Step 4: Add a score and timer</h1>
<p>We’ve got a ghost, but now we want to make a game! We want to score points every time we click on the ghost but we also want to have a time limit on the game. We can use a variable for the score and the timer.</p>
<section id="activity-checklist-4" class="level2 check">
<h2>Activity Checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <code>Variable</code> for all sprites called <strong>score</strong>, and alter the script for the ghost to increase this variable by one when it is clicked.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="blocks"><code>
    when [sprite1] clicked
    hide
    play sound [Fairydust]
    change score by (1)</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Switch to the <strong>Stage</strong> and create a <strong>new variable</strong> (this time just for the stage) called <strong>timer</strong>. Add a new script that occurs when the green flag is clicked to set <code>timer</code> to <strong>30</strong> and reset the score to <strong>0</strong>. Then use a <code>repeat until</code> block to wait a second and then reduce <code>timer</code> by<br />one. This should repeat until timer is 0, at which point use <code>stop all</code> to stop the game.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="blocks"><code>
    when FLAG clicked
    set [timer] to (30)
    set [score]to (0)
    repeat until &lt;[timer] = 0&gt;
        wait (1) secs
        change [timer] by (-1)
    
    stop all</code></pre>

<h2>Challenge: add more ghosts</h2>
<p>If one ghost is good, more must be better! <strong>Let’s have three ghosts flying around.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Duplicate the ghost by <strong>right-clicking</strong> it in the sprite list.<br /></li>
<li>For each ghost <strong>adjust the size of the sprite</strong> so the ghosts are different sizes.<br /></li>
<li>For each ghost change the <strong>speed variable</strong> so that they fly at different speeds.<br /></li>
